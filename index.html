                <h2>Beginning Roots</h2>
                <p>
                  The beginning of my journey began in 2019 where I discoverd the realm of <span style="color:#959d92">Data Analytics</span> and <span style="color:#959d92">Data Visualization.</span> I quickly became
                  fascinated with the idea of using data to build and create meaningful visualizations.
                  I always enjoyed creating, building, and drawing things for a variety of projects whether it be
                  personal or school-related growing up. Ironically, I did not enjoy math growing up. At all. So, I was hesitant to 
                  pursue anything that involved math. However, with time, I learned to tolerate math (and even enjoy it at times)
                  through my interests in Data Analytics and Information Design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I enjoy the process of designing, building, and understanding visualizations with data. 
                  I love that I can challenge myself when working with data sets because there is always something new to explore and probe. I rarely find myself running
                  out of ideas when looking at data because there is so much one can do with it! When I'm not working with numbers,
                  I enjoy spending my time reading, running, and finding inspiration for other creative activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through my passions and interests I also hope to inspire and build memorable experiences/relationships for others 
                  as I am always ideating new ways to create and design things to make <span style="color:#959d92">positive long lasting contributions.</span>
